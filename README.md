# OOJS: Model an Orange Tree
Forked from Dev Bootcamp.
Completed April 4, 2017. Completed in an afternoon.

## Skills
- OOJS javascript
- jasmine testing
- constructor and prototype functions

## Summary
Build JavaScript objects to hold states, attributes and behaviors.
These objects model oranges and orange trees.
Through constructor functions, each tree initializes with its own unique attributes: age, height, and a collection of oranges. On the other hand, the behaviors of orange trees will be shared.  All trees will share methods for aging, growing, etc.
